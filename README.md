# Coding-Projects

Hi! In this repository, you'll find some coding related projects. Academic and personal ones.

The academic projects are from my Dynamics of Combustion course and Numerical Methods in Mechanical Engineering course, which I took during my bachelors degree at McGill University. 
The file names for the 3 Dynamics of Combustion projects are:

P1_Hamard-260619897.ipynb

P2_Hamard-260619897.ipynb

P3_PierrickHamard-260619897.ipynb

For my Numerical Methods course:

M309_Project.m

The personal project I started last summer (2020) was to automate some processes to analyze my monthly financial activities and spending through VBA (excel). In a nutshell, it extracts information from statements you select to open, categorizes and sub-categorizes the statement's transactions based on the transacation description, and populates a master database. From there, you select the given month you want to analyze and voila! It outputs the total spending and % of overall total spending done for each sub-category for the chosen month (entertainment, groceries, etc.). It's an ongoing project that I work on from time to time, with many areas for improvement! The file for this project is called:

Finances.xlsm
