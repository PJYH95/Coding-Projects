# Coding-Projects

Hi! In this repository, you'll find some coding related projects. Academic and personal ones.

The academic projects are from my Dynamics of Combustion course and Numerical Methods in Mechanical Engineering course, which I took during my bachelors degree at McGill University. 
The file names for the 3 projects done for my Dynamics of Combustion course are:

P1_Hamard-260619897.ipynb

P2_Hamard-260619897.ipynb

P3_Hamard-260619897.ipynb

For my Numerical Methods course:

M309_Project.m

The personal project I started last summer (2020) was to automate some processes to analyze my financial activities and spending through VBA (excel). It's an ongoing project that I work on from time to time, with many areas for improvement! The file for this project is called:

Finances.xlsm
